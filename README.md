# Study-plan-with-greedy-algorithm
Background: We all have the same limited resource: 100 years of life, the most important currency rather than money. How to make more things done within limited time? When information is not enough, we can use greedy algorithm.
When I started my master's degree in 2023 at Northeastern, I was thinking about how to learn more before graduation, enable myself to make more contribution for the company I will work for. So, I plan to investigate market demand, and use greedy algorithm to learn things the market want.

Project solution: Build a MAXHEAP according to positions' salaries, by comparing differences between parent nodes and child nodes, calculate the approximate value of each skill, combining them with estimated study time, and use greedy algorithm to make a study plan.
